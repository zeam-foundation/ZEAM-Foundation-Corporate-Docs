# ZEAM-Foundation-Corporate-Docs

This folder contains the legal and structural formation documents for ZEAM Foundation LLC â€” the entity responsible for holding and enforcing the Immutable Core, Protocol Set, and Intellectual Property (IP) portfolio that underpin the ZEAM architecture.

ZEAM Foundation is not a startup.  
It is the root-level sovereign structure behind a post-capital cognition and governance system.

## Purpose

ZEAM Foundation exists to:

- Hold the exclusive IP governing cognition, memory, Flow, and sovereign agent infrastructure.
- Protect the Core from interference, dilution, and co-option.
- Govern the exclusive licensing relationship with ZEAM Labs LLC.
- Enforce the ethical and economic terms defined in the ZEAM License, including the 20% revenue flowback, 5% equity carve-outs, and permanent board representation.

## Legal Structure

- ZEAM Foundation LLC is a Delaware entity, 100% privately held.
- There are no investors, no external board, and no dilution path.
- The Operating Agreement is bare-bones and final: the Foundation is anchored, not governed.
